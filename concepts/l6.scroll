* Bell Telephone Laboratories' Low-Level Linked List Language L6 (pronounced “L-six”) is a new programming language for list structure manipulations. It contains many of the facilities which underlie such list processors as IPL, LISP, COMIT and SNOBOL, but permits the user to get much closer to machine code in order to write faster-running programs, to use storage more efficiently and to build a wider variety of linked data structures.

- L6 first developed in <a href="../lists/originCommunities.html#bellTelephoneLaboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a>
- L6 on HOPL
