 .* This is a comment line
 :userdoc.
 :title.Endangered Mammals
 :h1 res=001.The Manatee
 
 :p.
 The manatee has a broad flat tail and two flipper
 like forelegs.  There are no back legs.
 The manatee&#39;s large upper lip is split in two and
 can be used like fingers to place food into the
 mouth.  Bristly hair protrudes from its lips,
 and almost buried in its hide are small eyes, with
 which it can barely see.
