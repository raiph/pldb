* .properties is a file extension for files mainly used in Java related technologies to store the configurable parameters of an application. They can also be used for storing strings for Internationalization and localization; these are known as Property Resource Bundles. Each parameter is stored as a pair of strings, one storing the name of the parameter (called the key), and the other storing the value.. Read more on Wikipedia...

 # You are reading the &quot;.properties&quot; entry.
 ! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.
 # The key characters =, and : should be written with
 # a preceding backslash to ensure that they are properly loaded.
 # However, there is no need to precede the value characters =, and : by a backslash.
 website = https://en.wikipedia.org/
 language = English
 # The backslash below tells the application to continue reading

 # Add spaces to the key
 key\ with\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key &quot;key with spaces&quot;.
