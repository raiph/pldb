* IA-32 (short for "Intel Architecture, 32-bit", sometimes also called i386) is the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture, first implemented in the Intel 80386 microprocessors in 1985. IA-32 is the first incarnation of x86 that supports 32-bit computing; as a result, the "IA-32" term may be used as a metonym to refer to all x86 versions that support 32-bit computing. The IA-32 instruction set was introduced in the Intel 80386 microprocessor in 1985 and, as of 2017, remains supported by contemporary PC microprocessors. Read more on Wikipedia...
