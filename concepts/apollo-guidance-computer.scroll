* The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) was a digital computer produced for the Apollo program that was installed on board each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft. The AGC has a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit.

 ## At the get-together of the AGC developers celebrating the 40th anniversary

 ## naming of the routine.&lt;br&gt;
 ## &lt;br&gt;
 ## It traces back to 1965 and the Los Angeles riots, and was inspired 
 ## by disc jockey extraordinaire and radio station owner Magnificent Montague.
 ## Magnificent Montague used the phrase &quot;Burn, baby! BURN!&quot; when spinning the 
 ## hottest new records. Magnificent Montague was the charismatic voice of
 ## soul music in Chicago, New York, and
