* HP BASIC for OpenVMS is the latest name for a dialect of the BASIC programming language created by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and now owned by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE).  It was originally developed in the 1970s for the RSTS-11 operating system on the PDP-11 minicomputer.  It was later ported to OpenVMS, first on VAX, then Alpha, and most recently Integrity.
