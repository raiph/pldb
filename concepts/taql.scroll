* The Table Query Language (TaQL) is an SQL-like high level language to do operations like selection, sort, and update on a casacore table. It is a very versatile language with full support for table columns containing array data. It has inherent support for masked arrays, units, and astronomical coordinates. It has a very rich set of functions (like cone search and array reduction) making it very suitable for astronomical applications. User deÔ¨Åned functions can be added easily. It also has full support of grouping/aggregation and nested queries. An operation that can be expressed in a single function is the matching of two sky catalogues. It can be used from C++, Python, and the Casacore program taql.
