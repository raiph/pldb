Perl 6 (also known as Raku) is a member of the Perl family of programming languages.While historically several interpreter and compiler implementations were being written, today only the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation is in active development. It is introducing elements of many modern and historical languages. Compatibility with Perl 5 is not a goal, though a compatibility mode is part of the specification. Read more on Wikipedia...
