Lua ( LOO-ə, from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu.(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a lightweight, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded systems and clients. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter is written in ANSI C, and has a relatively simple C API. Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. Read more on Wikipedia...

print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)

# Hello World in Lua

print &quot;Hello world&quot;

-- A simple counting object that increments an internal counter whenever it receives a bang at its first inlet, or changes to whatever number it receives at its second inlet.

local HelloCounter = pd.Class:new():register(&quot;h-counter&quot;)

function HelloCounter:initialize(sel, atoms)
	self.inlets = 2
	self.outlets = 1
	self.num = 0
	return true
end

	self:outlet(1, &quot;float&quot;, {self.num})
	self.num = self.num + 1
end

function HelloCounter:in_2_float(f)
	self.num = f
