* Operational Control Language (OCL) is the control language of the IBM System/34 and System/36 minicomputer family. Other control languages include CL (System/38 and AS/400), JCL (System/370), and REXX (AS/400). The facility of DOS to use batch files is also control language.. Read more on Wikipedia...

 ** Procedure PROC1
 ** 
 ** Written by Joe User 2006-05-29
 **
 ** 
 // * &#39;PROC1 procedure is running&#39;
 // * &#39; &#39;
 // IFF ACTIVE-&#39;PROC2,PROC3&#39; GOTO OKAY
 ** IFF means &#39;if false&#39;
 ** ACTIVE-&#39;nnn,nnn2&#39; means at least one of the listed programs is currently running
 ** GOTO xxx means skip to the statement that says TAG xxx and resume processing
 // PAUSE &#39; Cannot continue because other Payroll is running&#39;
 // CANCEL                                               stops execution of this procedure
 // TAG OKAY
 // IFF DATAF1-PFILE1 IFF DATAF1-PFILE2 GOTO NODELT
 // * &#39; Caution, Pay Data Exists&#39;                        displays info on CRT
 // * &#39; &#39;
 // * &#39; Press 1 to continue and DELETE existing files&#39;
 // IFF &#39;1&#39;=?1R? CANCEL     A parameter is indicated by question marks surrounding a number
 ** Using 1R between question marks indicates that the parameter is required and processing
 ** waits for user input.  CANCEL means immediately go to end of job.
 // LOAD $DELET                                         $DELET is used to delete files
 // RUN
 // IF DATAF1-PFILE1 SCRATCH UNIT-F1,LABEL-PFILE1       deletes a disk file
 // IF DATAF1-PFILE2 SCRATCH UNIT-F1,LABEL-PFILE2
 // END                                              END returns control from a system program
 // LOAD PR101                                          PR101 is the sample RPG program
 // FILE NAME-PAYMAST,DISP-SHR                          PAYMAST is the payroll master file
 // FILE NAME-PFILE1,DISP-NEW,RECORDS-100,EXTEND-100    A new file PFILE1 is created
 ** 100 records are assigned to PFILE1 - if full, the system tries to extend it by another 100
 ** each time it fills.
 // RUN
 ** It&#39;s not necessary or valid to put an END statement after most user programs
 // SWITCH 1XXXXXXX                                    Causes U1 to be SETON in the RPG program
 // LOCAL OFFSET-1,DATA-&#39;PROC1&#39;      Places PROC1 in the Local Data Area
 // LOCAL OFFSET-101,DATA-&#39;?USER?&#39;   Substitutes the operator&#39;s User ID                        
 ** LDA becomes the external data structure (UDS) in an RPG program
 // LOAD PR102
 // FILE NAME-PAYMAST,DISP-SHR                         DISP-SHR means the file is shared
 ** Other programs can use PAYMAST at the same time
 // FILE NAME-PFILE,LABEL-PFILE1
 ** NAME/LABEL is used when the RPG disk file and the actual disk file names are different.
 // RUN
 // RETURN                                             Return means go to end-of-job
