codeWithHeader Example from <a href="../concepts/ion.html">Ion</a>:
 // The clob type is similar to blob in that it holds uninterpreted binary data. The difference is that the content is expected to be text, so we use a text notation thatâ€™s more readable than Base64.
 // An Ion clob type is similar to the blob type except that the denotation in the Ion text format uses an ASCII-based string notation rather than a base64 encoding to denote its binary value. It is important to make the distinction that clob is a sequence of raw octets and string is a sequence of Unicode code points.
 // The string may only contain legal 7-bit ASCII character
